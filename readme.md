# Grounds - # Transformice Lua API
This repository contains the source code for #Grounds.
This module contains functions that are only available to Luacrew members. This means that you can't run it in your tribe house.  

## What is Grounds?
Your aim in this minigame is to collect the cheese the faster you can, using the effects each ground offers.
There are also submodes that you can play via the room attribute "Number\*ModeName", like "#grounds0\*xmas" to run #xmas.
